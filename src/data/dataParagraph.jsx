    text: `The total average global temperature rise since the industrial revolution is around (1.0 °C / 1.8 °F). Earth northern hemisphere is warming faster. The arctic has warmed between (2 °C / 3.6 °F) and (4 °C / 7.2 °F). Earth temperature and the proportion of gases such as Co2, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere is strictly correlated.`,

  co2: {
    title: "Carbon Dioxide levels from 800,000 years ago to present",
    text: `For thousands of years, the natural concentration of CO2 in earth atmosphere was around 280 ppm. From the beginning of the industrial revolution, human activities like the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and livestock have increased this amount by more than 30%.`,
  },

  methane: {
    title: "Methane levels from 800,000 years ago to present",
    text: `Methane is a flammable gas formed by geological and biological processes. Some of the natural ones are leaks from natural gas systems and wetlands. 50-65% of total global methane emissions come from human activities. These include livestock, agriculture, oil and gas systems, waste from homes and businesses, landfills, and so on.`,
  },

  "nitrous-oxide": {
    title: "Nitrous Oxide levels from 800,000 years ago to present",
    text: `Nitrous oxide is a gas that is produced by the combustion of fossil fuel and solid waste, nitrogen-base fertilizers, sewage treatment plants, natural processes, and other agricultural and industrial activities. It is the third largest heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere and the biggest ozone-destroying compound emitted by human activities.`,
  },

  arctic: {
    title: "Melted Polar Ice Caps",
    text: `The arctic is warming around twice as fast as global average. Some of the reasons for this are: the arctic amplification, the albedo effect, and black carbon. From 1979 to 1996, we lost 2.2 - 3% of the arctic ice cover. From 2010 to present we are losing 12.85% per decade!`,
